General Information
The Bugtrace application is a bug tracking software that allows users to easily manage bug reports.  It is designed as a simplified Kanban board taking inspiration from tools such as trello and other bug tracking tools.  The simple drag and drop interface makes changing the status of bugs simple and allows users a fun and modern interface to interact with.  The software is currently in an alpha development phase and as such it is missing some features (editing of tags, management of archived bugs, user management, personalization etc).
